Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Check out my old [Website](https://www.martinbreuss.com). I made that a long time ago, it looks funny :)

These days, I primarily explore Python topics new and old, and create learning materials over at [Real Python](https://realpython.com/). I also wrote a [complete three-part Python course](https://codingnomads.com/about-python-101-course) that can help you get started with programming in Python over at [Codingnomads](https://codingnomads.com/).

Feel free to say hi if you want to :)
